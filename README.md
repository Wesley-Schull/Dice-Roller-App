# Dice-Roller-App
A program which rolls as many dice of whatever kind the user specifies.

The app is designed with multiple separate rolls in mind.

A simple example would be a Fireball from Dungeons & Dragons (5th Edition).
Upon use, the caster must roll 8d6 (which means to roll a 6-sided die 8
times). Of course, most regular players of the game might have multiple
sets of dice and doing so would be fairly easy, but what of those who only
have one set, or even none available to them? Rolling a die 8 times is
quite the chore, and it's not hard to lose count.

The app takes two inputs - one for the number of rolls, the other for the
number of faces on the die - and then generate rolls for the player. When
it finished, it displays each roll separately for easy reading.
